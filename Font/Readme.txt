ICAO font - read before use!
===========================


This font has been created for flight simulator developers who need to create realistic taxiway signs.

Strictly speaking this font is not related to the ICAO as it has been created using the official FAA regulations for airport signs:
http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/advisory_circular/150-5345-44H/150_5345_44h.pdf

I've still named it "ICAO_new" for easier identification and because airport signs outside the U.S. feature this font as well.

To avoid violation of FAA copyrights the font has been slightly changed (not visible to the naked eye) but is still more realistic than any other font or template.


Included are:

- letters A-Z (for easy use you don't need to type capitals, so a=A, q=Q,...)
- numbers 0-9
- arrows (Shift + 1-8)
- additional characters (see Windows character map for compendium)


How to use:

Move file into Windows/Fonts or double click and select "install". It will be available in all programs like Photoshop, Office,...




LIMITATIONS:
===========

You are allowed to use this font for development or share it among other developers only if you include this Readme.txt.
Any scenery/addon created with this font must include this in its manual/documentation:

"ICAO font used courtesy of Thorsten Reichert."
